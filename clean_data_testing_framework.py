# Question 2 :

# In production, we deal with data at scale ingested from various data sources. 
# How would you go about designing a testing framework to ensure that this data is clean after being processed?

# Please share a plan that is as granular and operation-able as possible.
# Feel free to start high- level, zoom into one data field, 
# e.g. NDC, and flesh it out to show how you would design it, using it as an example.
